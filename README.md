This is my Atari ST Emulator written in Javascript that i created over 10 years ago.

I no longer actively develop this but I may update to ensure browser compatibility from time to time.

I was asked to update this repo to include licensing information so that others may continue development.

Since this repo uses portions of code from SAE which is licensed under GPL V2 this is considered a derivative work and is also licensed under the same conditions.

See gpl.htm in this repo.
